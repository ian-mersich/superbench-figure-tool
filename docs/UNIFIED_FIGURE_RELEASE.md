# One Figure release for the browser and Superbench

The canonical Figure repository is `C:\Users\ianme\Desktop\Projects\superbench_figure_tool`.
The browser site and Superbench consume one committed editor and asset collection:
406 Library drawings representing 346 concepts in eight packs, and 12 editable
scientific scenes. Fixes belong here. Do not maintain a second editor in the
public source checkout or backport individual fixes into the old beta.6 site.

The 15 October product decision is recorded in
`config/scientific-product-release-2026-10-15.json`. It binds the exact accepted
artwork, scientific metadata, native-editing reviews and the owner's instruction
to release the reviewed Library in both consumers. It supplements the historical
pending product records; it does not rewrite them or create a new license grant.
The original 10 October CC0 grants and all predecessor/revision records remain
unchanged. The strict validator checks those records first, then accepts only the
finite reviewed product decision. See
`docs/scientific-assets/REVIEWED_LIBRARY_PRODUCT_RELEASE_2026_10_15.md`.

## Prepare the matched artifacts

Commit the reviewed version, runtime, assets, approval record and release tools
first. Use a short, fresh ignored output path to accommodate complete upstream
source trees on Windows:

```powershell
py -3 scripts/figure_tool_package_producer.py --revision <full-commit> --distribution-scope public-release --artifacts-only --source-exports --output-root qa_artifacts/u9
```

The producer archives that exact Git revision once. It validates every Library
pack, scene, license record, notice and vendor identity, then builds one payload.
It emits:

- A native tool-package ZIP, including its content-addressed manifest.
- A complete static ZIP containing the same `app/`, `vendor/`,
  `assets/scientific-packs/`, `assets/scientific-scenes/` and `web/` files.
- Source, web-shell, rights and release receipts. ZIP readback compares every
  decompressed static member against its native member and manifest hash.
- `source-repository/`, a slim public source export with the complete unchanged
  payload, validation tools, scientific review notes and source CI.
- `figure-tool-source.zip`, the same source plus verified preferred upstream
  source materials under `preferred-source-materials/`, outside every runtime root. Those materials never enter
  the browser/native payload. Full source ZIP readback checks every runtime file.

`SOURCE_RELEASE.json` describes the canonical commit, product version, package
digest, payload tree, immutable tag and vendor-source location. It is source
metadata outside the shared payload. The full archive and slim Git tree differ
only in source-material inclusion and that explicit location metadata. The code
license, CC0 artwork terms, complete third-party notices and source lock travel
with both. Fresh upstream compiler rebuilds are not qualified as byte-identical;
the local svg2pdf patch is checked against its pinned published input.

`--artifacts-only` issues no update catalog and reads no signing key. It retains
all public rights/product validators and rejects catalog/signing options. This
supports reviewed static hosting and a locally trusted immutable Superbench
package without provisioning an update-feed signer. A public automatic update
feed remains a separate signed-catalog operation.

## Qualify and promote the same release

Qualify the exact native/static payloads, including the current repaint, direct
selection, Library discovery and light/dark chrome fixes. Run the existing desktop
width/theme matrix and native Save/cold Open checks before promotion. Bind each
report to the canonical commit and semantic package digest. Independent visual
review is separate from structural pass counts. No open artwork or UI hold may
be reported as accepted.

The public source repository receives the reviewed `source-repository/` tree,
without private Git history or ignored QA/user files. Its immutable tag is
`v<product-version>`; the matching release attaches the producer's web ZIP as
`figure-tool-web.zip` and the full source archive as `figure-tool-source.zip`.
Renaming a release asset does not change its bytes.

The website consumer uses a pinned v2 `config/figure-release.json`: exact release
URL and ZIP SHA-256, canonical source revision, semantic package digest and payload
tree digest. It mounts the flat ZIP beneath `superbench/figure_tool/` unchanged.
Only outside the shared payload, it adds a root redirect to `web/` (preserving query
and fragment), root legal aliases copied from `app/legal/`, and source metadata.
It must not flatten `web/`, rewrite iframe paths, remove packs/scenes, or edit
runtime files. Verify the served `web/`, `app/`, vendors and assets against the same
payload inventory before publishing and again against the deployed HTTPS site.

Superbench's consumer installs and trusts that exact native package, retaining the
previous package for rollback. Its source pin must carry the real public-release
provenance. An existing compatible native host can consume it after the separate
headless native checks; a package update does not establish a new MSI qualification.

Publishing the public repository/release, updating the website, and changing the
actual local selected package remain explicit promotion steps after the matched
candidate is reviewed. All beta.6 repaint/backport candidates remain unpublished
historical diagnostics; they are not the next release path. The roadmap continues
with the shared Figure release and separate Windows installer qualification.
